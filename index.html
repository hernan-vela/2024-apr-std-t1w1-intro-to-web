            Imagine, if you can, writing something 
            that will one day be known universally 
            as “the Great American Novel.”

            <em>Mark Twain</em> did just that with <strong>Adventures 
            of Huckleberry Finn</strong> which was published in 1885.  
            It's predecessor, <strong>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</strong>, 
            came out nine years earlier and both became 
            worldwide favourites and are still read today 
            over a century later. Mark Twain is, deservedly, 
            still known as one of his country's greatest 
            writers which is remarkable considering that his 
            work was mostly around the end of the 19th century. 
            <em>The celebrated writer <b>William Faulkner</b>
            called him “the father of American literature.”</em>
